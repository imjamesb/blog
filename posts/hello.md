Hello, my name is James. I'm 20 years of age by the time this post is published.
I'm a hobbyist developer. I write libraries, frameworks, web apps and other
software. The languages I use the most include TypeScript and Rust. I also use
Deno and Node.js runtimes for server-side development.

On this blog I will write about discoveries I make, theories I have and
software, libraries and/or frameworks that I write.
